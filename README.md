ForensicEvidenceExplorer
Welcome to the ForensicEvidenceExplorer repository, your go-to guide for diving deep into the world of computer forensics. This repository is structured to provide step-by-step instructions on handling and analyzing digital evidence, with a strong emphasis on the use of OSForensics and FTK Imager. Through hands-on projects and exercises, you'll learn the essentials of evidence acquisition, the importance of hash values in forensic integrity, and the application of forensic tools in real-world scenarios.

Key Applications and Their Importance in Forensics
OSForensics
OSForensics is a powerful tool that allows investigators to analyze disk images, recover deleted files, and manage digital evidence. It's instrumental in creating and managing cases, making it easier to organize and search through large volumes of data efficiently.

FTK Imager
FTK Imager is a disk imaging tool that excels in creating exact copies of drives and media and calculating hash values for files. It's crucial for verifying the integrity of digital evidence, demonstrating that even the smallest change to a file (like altering a single letter) will result in a completely different hash value.

Exercises Overview
The repository contains detailed exercises that cover various aspects of computer forensics:

Exercise 4-1: Acquiring Evidence with OSForensics
Downloading and extracting USB drive images.
Creating a case and adding evidence for analysis.
Hands-On Project 4-4: Analyzing Hash Values with FTK Imager
